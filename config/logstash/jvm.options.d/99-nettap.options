# Malcolm's zeek pipeline (~75 config files with deeply nested conditionals)
# causes a StackOverflowError during recursive pipeline compilation.
# The default thread stack size (1m) is insufficient.
#
# NOTE: -Xss cannot be set via LS_JAVA_OPTS — Logstash 9.x's launcher
# filters it out. Drop-in files in jvm.options.d/ are the supported method.
